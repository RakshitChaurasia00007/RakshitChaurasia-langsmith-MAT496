- **Chain**: Combines multiple runs (LLM, Retriever, Tool) into a larger pipeline for complex workflows.
- **Prompt**: Hydrates prompts with structured context for LLMs.
- **Parser**: Extracts structured data from responses and response chunks.

## Setup and Environment Configuration

- How to correctly set API keys for OpenAI and LangSmith as environment variables (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `LANGSMITH_API_KEY`) or via `.env` files using `dotenv`.
- How to enable tracing globally with `LANGSMITH_TRACING="true"` and specify project name.

## Usage of Tracing for Different Runs

- **LLM**: How to trace chat-based models, with an example showing the input and output formats, including optional metadata (`ls_provider`, `ls_model_name`).
- **Streaming LLM**: How to handle chunked responses with a `reduce_fn()` to assemble the final output; demonstrated with an example.
- **Retriever**: How to trace document retrieval, return proper document objects (`page_content`, `type`, `metadata`) for proper visualization in traces.
