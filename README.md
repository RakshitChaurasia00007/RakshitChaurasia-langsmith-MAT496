##  Module 3 Lesson 1 Begins 

## What have we learned in the Video of the LESSON 1 ?
- We have learned about the functionality of Langsmith playground.
- We can use the playground to check on the LLM prompts.
- We have also learned how we can run experiments on the datasets from the playground which can be very useful to test the single step of our application.

## Experiments & Comparisions of Different LLM's using DATASET
(More llike exploring the playground section of the LANGSMITH)
Below are the screenshots of how I have completly explored LANGSMITH PLAYGROUND .

Screenshot 1 the below screenshot shows us the dataset which was created in my langsmith playground due to modifications in the file 
<img width="1366" height="599" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9306de1a-1e7f-4461-8a96-7c43c0204a32" />

Screenshot 2 When system is being asked to give output as a normal chatbot only 
<img width="1358" height="607" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c3918d5-d489-4685-ba5d-cd064fbe7518" />

Screenshot 3 when system is asked for being a professional lifestyle changer in 20's the response automatically changes .
<img width="1366" height="605" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8367c012-fa6b-436f-bde4-1836271f480b" />

Below is screenshot for runnable sequence data 1
<img width="1366" height="646" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd2d2cfa-b6cc-4296-a156-a36bb08d1877" />
Screenshot of runnable sequence data 2
<img width="1366" height="647" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/477b731b-a08d-4a3a-a3ae-8508c7ab1334" />

Below we have the screenshot of the location from where we can change the service provider , model like which LLM model do you wanna use .
We can also change the temprature, Max Tokens , Frequency Penalty , Reasoning Effort where temprature is for controling the creativity , max output token is like the maximum length of the model's response, frequency penalty is like the process of reducing the words which are repeated in our response, reasonning effort is like how much a model is trying to think deeply .

<img width="1366" height="648" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70f77205-71bd-47f7-8285-8f9d6b505ac9" />

Now there will be screenshot regarding comparision of output using different LLM models In one side we have O4-mini & O1-mini 
<img width="1366" height="606" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/961c05de-eb6b-413f-b6ba-271e80b93748" />
In the above screenshot we can see O4-MINI is more practical & energetic and O1-MINI is structured & thoughtful hence user can use the model according to their prefrences.

--
If we disable streaming we can run it with repititions.Repititions are usefule for consistency  and double check that we are able to respond towards a question correctly everytime.It is very useful when we have very high temprature. In the below screenshot by increasing repitition we have received 2 reponses for the same prompt.
<img width="1347" height="606" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f2fc47fd-b4be-468c-bb55-f4a70e58254c" />

<img width="1366" height="650" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a6554790-4610-4898-93ba-18679a77a5c7" />
The above screenshot show addition of schema in our process with description ,correctness strict & required string
<img width="1366" height="650" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0328d9df-403f-4501-8094-c0cd5d165a53" />
Below is the return with 1 response using output schema and it must match with the function definition.

<img width="1363" height="609" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8270d3c2-1402-43e3-b3de-6a91e72ff930" />

Now below I will attach the screenshot to show how Tabular view of our whole dataset looklike without running the LLM and after running the LLM on gpt O-4-MINI
First screenshot is about hoiw our dataset looks without running it on any LLM model .
<img width="1362" height="651" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53b92808-aba0-4596-9139-9b7a66920128" />
Now our Second screenshot is about how the dataset will looklike when we will run it on GPT o-4-MINI having system prompt as "You are a chatbot "
<img width="1366" height="650" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff356a6a-7451-4eaf-8cda-1385c5742e03" />
## Now I will adjust the system prompt a bit by writinning 
Earlier our system prompt was just "You are a chatbot"  But now our system prompt is "You are a chatbot and you have to keep your answers short to 2-3 words that's all."
<img width="1366" height="645" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/09f59330-1893-4213-b138-70cdc9baca04" />

## Module 3 Lesson 2 Begins

## What we have learned in the Lessons of Video 2
   We learned how we can save our prompts in the prompt template. 
   These saved prompts include list of templated messages & optional model configuration and also optionally constructed output.
   We can pull these prompts directly in our code and also push these prompts up from our code into SDK.

## Hence Now we will Begin our Work According to lesson 2 Video
